        cloud computing <br>
        <br>
        Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) <br>
        and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over <br>
        multiple locations, each of which is a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence<br>
        and typically uses a pay-as-you-go model, which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected<br>
        operating expenses for users. <br>
